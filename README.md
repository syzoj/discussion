## Starting a new discussion
Before starting a new discussion, please search in [Issues](https://github.com/syzoj/discussion/issues) to find if there's already another discussion issue opened by someone. It's better to just reply in that issue.

[Submit an issue](https://github.com/syzoj/discussion/issues/new) to start a discussion.

## Replying to a discussion
Replies are welcomed. But instead of just replying "+1", it's better to use thumb up/down to show your approval or disapproval to someone's comment.

Please respect each other's thoughts.
